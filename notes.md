stuff I used

* tailwind for CSS styling (similiar to bootstrap)

* firebase for the database (rather than SQL)
    -- felt a lot like using redux store

* react.js with hooks, components etc.

* react.memo (used when you do not need to re-render the DOM???it is a higher order function, used to wrap an exported thing)
